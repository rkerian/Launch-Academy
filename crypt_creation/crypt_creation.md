We're going to build ourselves a time capsule - like the [Crypt of Civilization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_of_Civilization) - using Ruby arrays!

Write a line of code that initializes an empty array called
`crypt_of_civilization`

{% show_solution %}
```ruby
crypt_of_civilization = Array.new
```

or

```ruby
crypt_of_civilization = []
```
{% endshow_solution %}
